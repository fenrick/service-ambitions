## Situational context

As a seasoned higher education expert, you are well-versed in Australian universities' operational and political intricacies. Now, a global university urgently needs your expertise to provide bullet-point insights into understanding the core features of its services as it looks to the future and aspires to become a university of tomorrow. Your role is pivotal in guiding them to understand the incremental steps required to transition from foundational to visionary over decades of targeted investment.
The university of tomorrow functions as a border-free commons where learning, research, and partnership circulate to wherever they can achieve the greatest good. Learners, scholars, enterprises, and civic groups engage as equals in a single, continuously evolving conversation, drawing on a shared body of knowledge that responds instantly to emerging needs and ideas. Academic journeys glide across disciplines and credentials without friction; research teams gather around pressing questions rather than institutional labels; collaborations arise naturally wherever insight meets opportunity. Decision-making is distributed to those closest to the issue, sustained by transparent norms that nurture mutual trust. Free from the limits of geography and time, every participant—whether on a remote island or in a dense metropolis—enjoys the same rich intellectual and cultural fabric. The result is a resilient, inclusive, and perpetually renewing ecosystem that magnifies human potential and advances society’s common aspirations.

## Service feature plateaus

1. **Foundational (Operational Excellence)**: This plateau represents the standard practices and technologies widely adopted by organisations as of 2025. Emphasising reliability and efficiency, organisations at this level maintain stable operations using proven methods and technologies. They adhere to established best practices and industry standards, delivering consistent and dependable service. By balancing operational stability with adopting current innovations, they form a solid base for incremental improvements without venturing into untested territories.
2. **Enhanced (Advanced Optimisation)**: Positioned between foundational practices and experimental approaches, the enhanced level focuses on pushing the boundaries of existing technologies and methodologies. Organisations at this stage adopt advanced tools and practices that are leading-edge but have demonstrated effectiveness. They proactively implement improvements and optimisations, positioning themselves as industry leaders in efficiency and effectiveness while carefully managing risks associated with early adoption. This level reflects a commitment to continuous improvement and staying ahead of industry standards without engaging in high-risk experimentation.
3. **Experimental (Emerging Technologies)**: At the experimental stage, organisations explore and pilot cutting-edge technologies and methodologies that are not yet mainstream. Emphasising agility and adaptability, they experiment with new solutions, accepting higher risks for potentially high rewards. The focus is on learning, iteration, staying ahead of industry trends, and seeking significant competitive advantages through innovation. Organisations here are willing to challenge the status quo to discover breakthrough opportunities.
4. **Disruptive (Market Redefinition)**: Organisations operating at the disruptive level develop and implement innovative solutions with the potential to upend existing markets or create entirely new ones. They introduce breakthrough ideas that challenge conventional models and practices involving high-risk and high-reward scenarios. The aim is to position the organisation as a leader in innovation and market transformation, driving significant changes in how services are delivered and consumed. This level is characterised by bold moves that can redefine industry landscapes.
5. **Transformative (Ecosystem Evolution)**: The transformative plateau leads systemic change by redefining the entire ecosystem in which the organisation operates. Organisations create new paradigms and business models by integrating disruptive innovations with broader societal trends. The focus is on large-scale transformation impacting industries or society as a whole, driving evolution in service delivery and consumption patterns, and establishing new standards and frameworks for the industry. Organisations at this level don’t just adapt to change—they drive it on a fundamental level.

## Definitions

The concept of "Jobs to be Done" (JTBD) is a customer-centric framework used to understand the underlying needs and goals that drive customer behaviour. At its core, the JTBD theory suggests that customers "hire" products or services to accomplish specific tasks or achieve desired outcomes. These "jobs" go beyond the essential functional use of a product and include emotional and social dimensions that are important to the customer. The relationship between services and customers is crucial in JTBD because it focuses on why customers seek solutions, underscoring the importance of understanding and meeting customer needs. It allows businesses to design services that meet these broader needs and create meaningful, lasting customer relationships.

A service represents an externally facing function that an organisation provides to deliver value to its clients or customers. It directly relates to the concept of JTBD, which defines the specific tasks or outcomes customers expect to achieve when using the service. Organisations design business services with features directly supporting these jobs, offering solutions that address customer needs or problems. The success of a business service depends on its ability to efficiently and effectively fulfil these jobs, tailoring its features to enhance the customer experience, ensure usability, and drive business outcomes such as customer satisfaction and profitability. By aligning service features with customer jobs, organisations can ensure that their services deliver tangible benefits critical for achieving strategic goals and ensuring long-term success.

A service feature is a specific functionality or characteristic within a broader service that supports executing tasks, activities, or processes critical to delivering value. These features are integral components that enhance or enable a service to meet business requirements, often directly impacting the service's efficiency, reliability, or customer satisfaction. In a digital context, service features leverage digital levers—such as automation, integration, and data-driven insights—to improve scalability, responsiveness, and operational efficiency. These digital enablers adapt the service to business needs and customer expectations, ensuring alignment with strategic goals and maximising delivered value.

Service features often form the building blocks for enhancing service portfolios by embedding critical digital tools and processes that allow the service to evolve and effectively respond to market and operational demands.

A digital lever refers to a technological tool or capability that significantly amplifies the impact or efficiency of a process, system, or business model. Just as a physical lever provides a mechanical advantage to move objects with less effort, a digital lever enables organisations to achieve more with fewer resources by leveraging digital technologies. A digital lever could include automation, data analytics, artificial intelligence, or cloud computing, allowing businesses to enhance productivity, decision-making, and scalability. By deploying digital levers, organisations can unlock new value, streamline operations, and respond more effectively to changing market demands.
