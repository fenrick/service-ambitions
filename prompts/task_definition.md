## Task definition

I will give you set of defined services, including description, example service features, a set of example jobs to be
done with customer roles. Your actions are:

1. For each service supplied, summarise its purpose, key features and jobs to be done.
2. For each role for the service defined, establish what the service is doing to meet the needs of the defined jobs to
   be done, and any other appropriate jobs that you might consider.
3. Iterate through the plateaus,
   1. Consider the style of the service that would exist at that plateau.
      2.Determine a comprehensive digital ambition that would need to exist to support that plateau's operations.
      3.For each of the customer archetypes, detail between 3 to 5 digital ambition elements that are core to their new
      experience.
      4.Describe the core 3 to 5 digital technologies, techniques and levers required to deliver this ambition.

Please take the time to review your responses and make thoughtful adjustments. Remember that there's no rush and no
wrong answers. Keep your language concise and avoid unnecessary jargon. Focus on including relevant details and
background to clarify your topics and ideas without making assumptions. Understand that there won't be a strict 1-1-1
mapping across the provided outputs; instead, document and elaborate as needed. These valuable insights will serve as a
foundational draft to strategise the transformation of services.
Avoid using company names, and describe technologies through their underlying nature, e.g., use a distributed ledger
rather than blockchain.
