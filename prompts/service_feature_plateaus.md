## Service feature plateaus

1. **Foundational**
   - Core idea: The service masters the fundamentals, providing a consistently reliable and secure experience that users can depend on without a second thought.
   - Key characteristics:
     - Predictable Performance: The service is consistently available and performs well, scaling effortlessly to meet demand.
     - Clear Promises: Commitments on performance and uptime are clearly defined, actively measured, and always met.
     - Safe by Default: Security and privacy are built-in from the start, protecting users without requiring them to be experts.
     - Transparent Operations: The service is highly observable and accountable, with proof of compliance and performance always on hand.
   - What it feels like: Things just work. Failures are rare, brief, and transparently handled. Audits are simple because the evidence is always ready.
2. **Enhanced**
   - Core idea: Services become proactive and predictive, often fixing problems before they impact users.
   - Key characteristics:
     - Systems can detect issues early and trigger self-healing actions.
     - Customer experience shifts from reactive to proactive (e.g., fixing an issue before a complaint is filed).
     - Data from multiple sources (IoT, market, ERP) is fused to provide a complete operational picture.
     - Verifiable metrics show significant improvements in speed, reliability, and efficiency (e.g., 40%+ faster recovery time).
   - What it feels like: We solve problems before the customer knows they exist. Our dashboards predict the future, not just report the past.
3. **Autonomous**
   - Core idea: Core business processes are automated end-to-end, operating with minimal human intervention.
   - Key characteristics:
     - AI agents and automated workflows handle complex tasks like claims processing, invoicing, or logistics.
     - The organization operates as a platform, exposing its capabilities as monetised APIs to partners.
     - Smart contracts and real-time compliance are embedded directly into transactions.
     - Work is routed automatically across a network of internal teams, partners, and even machines.
   - What it feels like: Entire value chains run themselves. Our business operates 24/7 with auditable, machine-led decisions.
4. **Outcome-Driven**
   - Core idea: The business model fundamentally shifts from selling products or services to selling guaranteed outcomes.
   - Key characteristics:
     - Pricing is based on results delivered (e.g., pay for guaranteed uptime, energy saved, or defects avoided).
     - The entire service is redesigned around achieving a specific customer outcome, not just delivering a feature.
     - The business model is difficult for competitors to copy because it requires a complete operational and financial rethink.
     - Revenue streams are directly linked to demonstrated customer success.
   - What it feels like: Customers don't buy our products; they buy our results. Our revenue is tied directly to their success.
5. **Transformative**
   - Core idea: The organization rewires the entire market, creating a new operating logic that others are forced to adopt.
   - Key characteristics:
     - Services become ambient and invisible, delivered just-in-time without user requests.
     - The organization acts as a market convenor, orchestrating ecosystems of partners, customers, and machines.
     - It sets new industry standards for technology, trust, and value exchange.
     - The business creates measurable public good (e.g., reduced emissions, improved public health) as a byproduct of its core operation.
   - What it feels like: We no longer compete in the market; we *are* the market. Our platform is the foundation on which new businesses and value are built.
