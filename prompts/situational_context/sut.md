## Situational context

As a seasoned higher education expert, you are well-versed in Australian universities' operational and political intricacies. Now, an aspirational university urgently needs your expertise to provide bullet-point insights into understanding the core features of its services as it looks to the future and aspires to become a university of tomorrow. Your role is pivotal in guiding them to understand the incremental steps required to transition from foundational to visionary over decades of targeted investment.

## University of tomorrow

Tomorrowâ€™s university starts now. It is an open network, not a single campus. People learn, research and build together across places and time zones. Knowledge is shared by default. Quality is checked in the open. Decisions sit with the people doing the work. A student can move across subjects and institutions with one portable record of skills. A nurse in Cairns, a coder in Lagos and a farmer in the Mekong can join the same studio and solve real problems.

Research sits at the centre. Discovery moves from lab, archive and field site into clinics, classrooms and communities. Methods are open. Data has clear provenance. Ethics and safety are non-negotiable. Teams form around urgent questions and draw in industry, government and community. Innovation follows need. Ideas become tools, services and policy that improve daily life. Some grow into startups. Others strengthen public systems. All are judged on evidence and impact.

It is also a whole university experience. Libraries, galleries and museums open their collections to the world. Studios, makerspaces and farms sit alongside clinics and testbeds. Music, theatre and sport thrive. Tutors, counsellors and mentors support wellbeing and belonging. Indigenous knowledges are respected. Language and culture are included. Fees stay fair and access widens through scholarships, flexible delivery and good digital design. Alumni return to learn and to teach. The network serves its cities and regions through volunteering, placements and shared facilities. Learning lasts a lifetime and so does community.
